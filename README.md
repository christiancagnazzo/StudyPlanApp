# Study Plan App 

A full-stack application to manage the university study plan. The project has been implemented for the  "Web Application I" university course.

## React Client Application Routes

- Route `/`: always redirects to `/home`
- Route `/login`: contains the form to login
- Route `/home`: contains the list of courses and their information; it is also accessible by non-logged in users
- Route `/logged-home`: contains the list of courses on the left and the study plan, if any, on the right; it is reachable only by logged in users
- Route `/logged-home/edit`: as logged-home, but also enables buttons to edit the study plan and shows additional information about courses that cannot be added or that are subject to constraints 
- Route `/error`: it is addressed in case of serious server-side errors (such as unreachable database) and shows an error message, but is not reachable if there are no errors
